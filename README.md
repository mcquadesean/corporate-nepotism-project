# Corporate Nepotism Project: Sean McQuade Undergraduate Thesis
This repository contains replication materials for my undergraduate thesis titled, "When Dad is the CEO: How familial ties in the executive suite affect displays of organizational empathy."

## Repository Layout
In the two main folders, data_analysis and data_collection, are the majority of programs and output used to produce the conclusions in my thesis manuscript. 

### Data Collection
The data collection folder contains the Python scripts used to obtain the project's flagship dataset. It also includes the dataset itself. The excel file in the output folder contains my hand-coding of each sentence as "executive" and "non-executive" nepotism. 

### Data Analysis
The data analysis section contains R code used to run both the main and robustness regressions. I included results in the form of coefficient plots.
